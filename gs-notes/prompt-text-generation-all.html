            <p>Certainly, let&#39;s delve into how you can craft detailed prompts for the various content types and tasks you&#39;ve listed, drawing upon the principles and examples provided in the sources. The goal is to provide sufficient detail and structure, akin to the &quot;Advanced Prompt&quot; examples, to guide the AI towards the desired output for each specific task.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown for each item, based on the information in the sources:</p>
<h3>1. Birthday Invitations</h3>
<p>While the sources mention birthday invitations as a layman&#39;s example for content creation, they don&#39;t provide a specific detailed strategy just for invitations. However, we can apply the general principles for text generation and output formatting.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To generate text for a birthday invitation that is fun, playful, and includes essential details.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Context, Output Indicator/Format, Tone, Audience, Specific Points to Cover.</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Clearly specify the content type: &quot;Create a birthday invitation&quot;.</li>
<li>Define the target audience (e.g., &quot;for a 10-year-old&#39;s superhero-themed party&quot;). This helps the AI set the appropriate tone and style.</li>
<li>Specify the desired tone (&quot;fun and playful&quot;).</li>
<li>Include essential details that must be present (&quot;including placeholders for date, time, location, and RSVP details&quot;).</li>
<li>Specify formatting if needed (e.g., bullet points for details, specific sections).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework:</strong>
&quot;<strong>Instruction:</strong> Create the text for a birthday invitation.
<strong>Context:</strong> The invitation is for a 10-year-old&#39;s superhero-themed party.
<strong>Tone:</strong> Fun and playful.
<strong>Audience:</strong> Friends and family of the 10-year-old.
<strong>Points to Cover:</strong> Include placeholders for [Date], [Time], [Location], and [RSVP Details].
<strong>Format:</strong> Present the main invitation text, followed by the details clearly listed.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing the age, theme, tone, and required placeholders gives the AI the necessary context and constraints to generate text that is both appropriate for the event and contains all the critical information. Clear instructions and format requests improve output quality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Marketing Copy</h3>
<p>Marketing copy is mentioned as a type of content that prompt engineers can generate, specifying tone, style, length, target audience, keywords, and desired structure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To generate persuasive or informative text for marketing purposes that meets specific requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Context, Output Indicator/Format, Tone, Style, Audience, Length Constraints, Specific Points/Keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Clearly state the type of marketing copy needed (e.g., &quot;Generate marketing copy for a product description,&quot; &quot;Write ad text&quot;).</li>
<li>Define the target audience explicitly (e.g., &quot;Target audience: small business owners,&quot; &quot;for millennials interested in sustainability&quot;).</li>
<li>Specify the desired tone and style (e.g., &quot;enthusiastic and persuasive tone,&quot; &quot;professional and action-oriented manner,&quot; &quot;confident, evidence-based style&quot;).</li>
<li>Include key features, benefits, or unique selling points that must be highlighted.</li>
<li>Set length constraints (e.g., &quot;maximum 150 words,&quot; &quot;short and punchy&quot;).</li>
<li>Mention any required calls to action or keywords.</li>
<li>Define the purpose (e.g., &quot;to drive conversions,&quot; &quot;to build brand awareness&quot;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Inspired by and general text generation principles):</strong>
&quot;<strong>Instruction:</strong> Generate marketing copy for a new online course.
<strong>Context:</strong> The course is titled &#39;Mastering Prompt Engineering&#39; and is aimed at marketers looking to improve AI content creation.

<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> By specifying audience, purpose, tone, style, key points, and constraints, you direct the AI to create copy that is tailored, effective, and aligns with marketing goals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Technical Documentation</h3>
<p>Technical documentation generation is another application mentioned for prompt engineers, implying the need to specify technical details and potentially structure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To generate clear, accurate, and structured documentation for technical topics or products.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Context, Input Data, Output Indicator/Format, Tone, Style, Audience, Specific Points.</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Clearly state the type of documentation needed (e.g., &quot;Write API documentation,&quot; &quot;Create a user manual section,&quot; &quot;Generate a technical overview&quot;).</li>
<li>Define the target audience (e.g., &quot;for developers,&quot; &quot;for end-users with basic technical understanding,&quot; &quot;for experts&quot;). The &quot;Explain like I&#39;m a fellow expert, but be precise and thorough&quot; style instruction is relevant here. Controlling technical density is also key.</li>
<li>Provide the specific technical details, concepts, or functionalities to be documented. This could be framed as Input Data.</li>
<li>Specify the desired tone and style (e.g., &quot;formal and objective tone,&quot; &quot;clear and concise,&quot; &quot;technical but accessible&quot;).</li>
<li>Define the required structure or format (e.g., &quot;include an introduction, parameter descriptions, example usage, and return values,&quot; &quot;use Markdown for headings and code blocks&quot;). Explicit format requests and schema/template provision are effective.</li>
<li>Mention any specific terminology or conventions to follow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Inspired by and technical documentation needs):</strong>
&quot;<strong>Instruction:</strong> Generate technical documentation for a Python function.
<strong>Context:</strong> The function is named <code>calculate_fibonacci</code> and takes an integer <code>n</code> as input, returning a list of the first <code>n</code> Fibonacci numbers. Assume <code>n</code> is a non-negative integer.
<strong>Audience:</strong> Developers using the function.
<strong>Tone &amp; Style:</strong> Formal, precise, and objective. Use technical terminology appropriate for developers.
<strong>Structure &amp; Format:</strong> Provide documentation in Markdown format. Include:<ul>
<li>A brief description of the function&#39;s purpose.</li>
<li>Parameters section (name, type, description, constraints).</li>
<li>Return Value section (type, description).</li>
<li>Example Usage section with a clear Python code snippet and expected output.</li>
<li>Notes on time complexity.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Combining precise instructions with specific technical details, audience definition, and formatting constraints ensures the generated documentation is accurate, relevant, and structured appropriately for its intended users.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Creative Writing (Stories, Poems, Scripts)</h3>
<p>Creative writing is explicitly covered with specific strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To generate original and imaginative content based on given themes, styles, or constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Context, Output Indicator/Format, Tone, Style, Audience, Length Constraints, Specific Points (Genre, Theme, Plot, Character, Setting, Structure). Persona can also be used, like &quot;Act as a seasoned travel blogger&quot; for descriptions or &quot;You are a bard&quot; for storytelling.</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Specify the type of creative content (e.g., &quot;Write a short science fiction story,&quot; &quot;Write a poem about autumn,&quot; &quot;Create a character profile&quot;).</li>
<li>Define the genre, theme, and key plot points.</li>
<li>Include character details, setting descriptions, and any specific elements to feature.</li>
<li>Specify the desired style and tone (e.g., &quot;suspenseful tone,&quot; &quot;in the style of Robert Frost,&quot; &quot;rich atmospheric descriptions,&quot; &quot;period-appropriate dialogue&quot;). Stylistic emulation can use few-shot examples or explicit instruction.</li>
<li>Add constraints, such as length (e.g., &quot;around 1000 words,&quot; &quot;a haiku&quot;), required elements (e.g., &quot;an unexpected twist ending,&quot; &quot;at least three red herrings&quot;), or things to avoid.</li>
<li>Structure requirements can be specified (e.g., &quot;Divide the story into three parts&quot;).</li>
<li>Using a higher temperature setting is often suggested to encourage creativity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Advanced Story Generation Example from sources):</strong>
&quot;You are a master storyteller in the style of Agatha Christie. Write a 1000-word mystery story with the following specifications:
<strong>Setting:</strong> A remote lighthouse on a stormy island off the coast of Scotland in 1935
<strong>Protagonist:</strong> Eleanor Blackwood, a sharp-witted former Scotland Yard detective with a troubled past
<strong>Plot:</strong> A valuable artifact has disappeared from the lighthouse keeper&#39;s quarters, and all five inhabitants of the island are suspects
<strong>Style:</strong> Include rich atmospheric descriptions, period-appropriate dialogue, and at least three red herrings
<strong>Structure:</strong> Divide the story into three parts - the setup, the investigation, and the revelation
<strong>Ending:</strong> Conclude with a surprising but logical twist that the reader could have plausibly deduced from clues in the story.
The story should maintain suspense throughout and reveal the culprit only in the final paragraphs.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The LLM draws upon patterns from various literary genres and styles in its training data. Specific prompts guide it to combine these patterns in novel ways, constrained by the given elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Code Generation</h3>
<p>Code generation is a well-defined task with specific prompting strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To produce functional and efficient code in a specified programming language based on a description of the task or desired functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Context, Input Data (existing code/specs), Output Indicator/Format (language, comments, structure), Constraints (performance, style, libraries). Persona can be used, like &quot;You are an expert Python developer&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Specify the programming language and potentially the version (e.g., &quot;Write a Python function,&quot; &quot;using JavaScript&quot;).</li>
<li>Clearly describe the functionality needed.</li>
<li>Include constraints or requirements, such as handling empty lists, specific libraries/frameworks (&quot;using the pandas library,&quot; &quot;Generate an Express.js route&quot;), performance requirements, or code style standards (&quot;include type hints and a docstring,&quot; &quot;follow PEP 8 style guidelines&quot;).</li>
<li>Provide context, such as existing code or a class definition that the new code needs to integrate with.</li>
<li>Include input/output examples to clarify the expected behavior, which is described as implementing test-driven specification.</li>
<li>Ask for explanations or comments within the code. Leverage language-specific documentation conventions.</li>
<li>Define interface contracts and dependency management approaches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Advanced Project Prompt Example from sources):</strong>
&quot;You are an expert Python developer. Create a complete Flask web application for a simple task management system with the following specifications:
<strong>Functionality:</strong> Users should be able to view, add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, and a status (e.g., &#39;pending&#39;, &#39;completed&#39;). Use a simple SQLite database to store tasks.
<strong>Requirements:</strong><ul>
<li>Use Flask for the web framework.</li>
<li>Use SQLAlchemy for database interaction.</li>
<li>Implement basic error handling for invalid inputs.</li>
<li>The application should be runnable locally.</li>
<li>Include basic HTML templates for the user interface.
<strong>Output Structure:</strong> Provide the complete project structure and code for all necessary files, including:</li>
<li><code>app.py</code> (main application file)</li>
<li><code>models.py</code> (database models)</li>
<li><code>routes.py</code> (API endpoints)</li>
<li><code>forms.py</code> (form validation)</li>
<li><code>templates/</code> (HTML templates)</li>
<li><code>static/</code> (CSS and JavaScript)</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code>
<strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code should be production-ready, well-documented, and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The LLM draws upon its training data of code patterns and syntax. Explicit instructions, constraints, and examples help it generate syntactically correct and functionally appropriate code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Articles, 7. Blog Posts, 8. Stories, 9. Emails, 10. Reports, 11. Essays (as text generation)</h3>
<p>These fall under the broad category of Text Generation, for which specific strategies are outlined. Stories were covered under Creative Writing, but the general text generation principles also apply. Emails and Reports are mentioned in examples related to tone and style. Essays are mentioned as a use case for pre-computation/decomposition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To generate various forms of text content tailored to a specific purpose, audience, style, and format.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Context, Input Data (if summarizing or rewriting), Output Indicator/Format, Tone, Style, Audience, Length Constraints, Specific Points/Keywords, Structure. Persona can be used to guide style and tone.</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Specify the exact type of content required (e.g., &quot;Write a blog post,&quot; &quot;Draft an email,&quot; &quot;Generate a report summary,&quot; &quot;Compose an essay section&quot;).</li>
<li>Define the audience demographics and knowledge level.</li>
<li>Indicate the desired tone and style (e.g., &quot;professional and authoritative,&quot; &quot;casual and humorous,&quot; &quot;formal, apologetic&quot;). Reference familiar styles if helpful.</li>
<li>Provide length parameters (word count, paragraph count).</li>
<li>Include specific points, topics, or arguments to cover. For persuasive content, specifying rhetorical strategies might be relevant.</li>
<li>Provide structural guidance (headings, sections, paragraphs, introduction, conclusion). Implement hierarchical structuring for long-form content. Use explicit discourse planning for complex arguments.</li>
<li>Specify the purpose (inform, persuade, entertain).</li>
<li>Leverage positional encoding sensitivities by front-loading critical parameters.</li>
<li>Employ domain-specific lexical triggers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Advanced Article/Blog Post Example from sources):</strong>
&quot;You are a health and wellness expert with a background in neuroscience. Write a comprehensive, evidence-based article about meditation with the following specifications:
<strong>Title:</strong> 7 Ways Meditation Reshapes Your Brain (According to Science)
<strong>Target Audience:</strong> Educated general audience interested in science-backed wellness practices.
<strong>Purpose:</strong> To inform and persuade readers about the tangible cognitive benefits of meditation.
<strong>Content Requirements:</strong><ul>
<li>Engage readers immediately with a compelling hook.</li>
<li>Explain the basic concept of meditation briefly.</li>
<li>Detail 7 specific, distinct cognitive benefits (e.g., improved focus, stress reduction, emotional regulation, altered brain structure/function).</li>
<li>For each benefit, briefly reference scientific findings or mechanisms (no need for formal citations, just indicate the scientific basis).</li>
<li>Section addressing common objections with evidence-based counterpoints.</li>
<li>Practical implementation guide for beginners.</li>
<li>Conclusion with call-to-action (e.g., suggest trying a simple guided meditation).
<strong>Tone:</strong> Authoritative but accessible, evidence-driven but not academic, persuasive without being preachy.
<strong>Avoid:</strong> Spiritual terminology, making unsubstantiated claims, using jargon without explanation.
<strong>Length:</strong> 800-1000 words.
<strong>Structure:</strong> Use clear headings and subheadings. Ensure smooth transitions between sections.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> LLMs generate text token by token, drawing on patterns learned during training. Explicit instructions guide this process by influencing lexical selection, syntactic complexity, discourse markers, and overall register consistency to match the desired style and content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>12. Explanations (simplifying difficult concepts or explaining intricate topics)</h3>
<p>Explaining concepts in a tailored manner is listed as an expert application of prompt engineering for learning and knowledge acquisition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To explain complex or intricate topics clearly, often by simplifying them for a specific audience.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Context, Input Data (the concept), Output Indicator/Format, Tone, Style, Audience. Persona can be used, like &quot;You are an expert astrophysicist&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Clearly state the concept or topic to be explained.</li>
<li>Define the target audience and their existing knowledge level explicitly (e.g., &quot;explain to me like I&#39;m a 10-year-old,&quot; &quot;Explain... to a college student,&quot; &quot;Condense... understandable by a non-technical manager&quot;). This allows the AI to adjust technical density.</li>
<li>Specify the desired tone and style (e.g., &quot;using simple analogies,&quot; &quot;friendly and informative tone&quot;).</li>
<li>Include any specific points that must be covered or aspects to focus on.</li>
<li>Define the desired format or length if necessary (e.g., &quot;one-paragraph summary&quot;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Inspired by examples in):</strong>
&quot;<strong>Instruction:</strong> Explain a complex scientific concept.
<strong>Concept:</strong> Quantum entanglement.
<strong>Audience:</strong> A bright high school student with a basic understanding of physics, but no prior knowledge of quantum mechanics.
<strong>Tone &amp; Style:</strong> Engaging, clear, and use simple analogies where appropriate. Avoid advanced jargon unless absolutely necessary, and explain any technical terms used.
<strong>Points to Cover:</strong> Explain the core idea, the concept of spooky action at a distance, and why it&#39;s significant. Do not cover Bell&#39;s Theorem or specific experiments in detail.
<strong>Length:</strong> Approximately 300-400 words.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> By defining the audience and their knowledge level, specifying the required tone and style, and setting boundaries on the content, the AI can tailor the explanation to be easily understood.</li>
</ul>
<h3>13. Summarization (condensing documents or text)</h3>
<p>Summarization is a key task for prompt engineering, with specific strategies outlined. For long documents, techniques like Recursive Summarization and Map-Reduce style summarization are mentioned.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To condense lengthy text into a shorter version while preserving key information and meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Input Data (the text to summarize), Output Indicator/Format, Tone, Style, Audience, Constraints (length, focus). Context can include the purpose of the summary.</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Clearly state the instruction: &quot;Summarize the following text...&quot;.</li>
<li>Provide the text to be summarized as Input Data. Delimiters can be used to separate the instruction from the text.</li>
<li>Specify the desired length and format (e.g., &quot;in three bullet points,&quot; &quot;into exactly three sentences,&quot; &quot;one-paragraph summary&quot;). Length parameters are critical constraints.</li>
<li>Define the focus or aspects to include (e.g., &quot;focusing on the main challenges discussed,&quot; &quot;focusing on the main event and its immediate impact,&quot; &quot;summarize... methodology section&quot;).</li>
<li>Specify the target audience, as this influences the level of detail and terminology (e.g., &quot;for a general audience,&quot; &quot;understandable by a non-technical manager,&quot; &quot;suitable for a technical audience&quot;).</li>
<li>Implicitly or explicitly guide whether the summary should be extractive (using phrases directly from the source) or abstractive (rephrasing). Prompts like &quot;Rewrite and summarize...&quot; encourage abstraction.</li>
<li>For very long documents, use techniques like breaking text into chunks, summarizing each chunk, and then synthesizing the chunk summaries into a final summary. Provide context about how the summary will be used (e.g., &quot;The summary will be combined with other summaries...&quot;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Combining strategies from):</strong>
&quot;<strong>Instruction:</strong> Summarize the following article.
<strong>Input Data:</strong> [Insert the full text of the article here, potentially within delimiters like triple quotes].
<strong>Focus:</strong> Highlight the key findings, methodologies, and novel contributions.
<strong>Audience:</strong> Technical audience familiar with the subject matter.
<strong>Format &amp; Length:</strong> Provide the summary as a single paragraph, no more than 500 words, suitable for an abstract. The summary should be abstractive, rephrasing the original content rather than just extracting sentences.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The LLM identifies salient information based on the instructions, its understanding of discourse structure, and constraints like length. For long texts, chunking and recursive summarization help manage the context window limitation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>14. Translation (converting text between languages)</h3>
<p>Translation is another core task for LLMs, with specific prompting strategies described. Zero-shot prompting is a common approach for simple translations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To convert text from a source language to a target language accurately, maintaining meaning, tone, and style.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Input Data (the text to translate), Context (for ambiguity or style), Output Indicator/Format (language, formality).</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Clearly specify the language pair: &quot;Translate the following English text to formal German: &#39;[English text]&#39;&quot; or &quot;Translate this casual chat message from Japanese to informal English&quot;.</li>
<li>Provide the text to be translated as Input Data.</li>
<li>Include contextual information for ambiguous terms, culturally specific content, or the situation the text will be used in (e.g., &quot;Translate this marketing slogan for a Spanish-speaking audience in Mexico, ensuring it sounds catchy and culturally appropriate&quot;). Context helps disambiguate and improve relevance.</li>
<li>Specify the desired style, tone, or formality level (e.g., &quot;formal,&quot; &quot;informal,&quot; &quot;casual,&quot; &quot;catchy&quot;).</li>
<li>For technical or specialized content, you can provide domain-specific terminology or examples (using few-shot) to ensure correct translation (e.g., &quot;Translate this medical abstract, ensuring all anatomical terms are translated according to standard medical terminology&quot;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Combining strategies from):</strong>
&quot;<strong>Instruction:</strong> Translate the following text.
<strong>Input Data:</strong> &#39;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&#39;
<strong>Source Language:</strong> English.
<strong>Target Language:</strong> French.
<strong>Formality:</strong> Maintain a standard, slightly formal level appropriate for general written communication.
<strong>Context:</strong> This is a test sentence used to demonstrate typography, not part of a larger narrative.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The LLM leverages its multilingual training data to find equivalences. Explicit instructions on language pair, formality, and context help it select the most appropriate translation from its learned patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>15. Extracting Specific Information (from text)</h3>
<p>Extracting specific information is mentioned as an expert application. Few-shot learning examples are used to demonstrate pattern extraction, specifically for turning unstructured text into a structured format like JSON. Explicit format requests are also a strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To identify and pull out particular pieces of data or information from a given text.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Input Data (the text to extract from), Output Indicator/Format, Examples (Few-shot).</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li>Clearly instruct the model to extract specific information: &quot;Extract the name, email, and phone number from the following text...&quot;.</li>
<li>Provide the text containing the information as Input Data.</li>
<li>Specify the desired output format, often structured data like JSON or a table. Including the schema or an empty template is highly effective. For example, &quot;provide the output as a JSON object with keys &#39;name&#39;, &#39;email&#39;, and &#39;phone&#39;&quot;.</li>
<li>Use few-shot examples to demonstrate the extraction pattern and desired output format. This is particularly useful for complex or non-obvious extraction tasks. Ensure examples are diverse but representative and consistently formatted.</li>
<li>Define constraints on the extraction (e.g., only extract information about people from a specific company).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Combining strategies from):</strong>
&quot;<strong>Instruction:</strong> Extract contact information from the following text and format it as JSON.
<strong>Examples (Few-Shot):</strong>
Input: &#39;Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a> or call +1-555-123-4567 for details.&#39;
Output: {&#39;email&#39;: &#39;<a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a>&#39;, &#39;phone&#39;: &#39;+1-555-123-4567&#39;}
Input: &#39;Please send inquiries to <a href="mailto:support@company.org">support@company.org</a>.&#39;
Output: {&#39;email&#39;: &#39;<a href="mailto:support@company.org">support@company.org</a>&#39;}
Input: &#39;Reach out via mobile at 987-654-3210.&#39;
Output: {&#39;phone&#39;: &#39;987-654-3210&#39;}
<strong>Input Data (Text to Extract From):</strong>
&#39;Hello team, you can reach me at my new email address, <a href="mailto:alice.smith@work.net">alice.smith@work.net</a>, or via phone at (123) 456-7890. My old number is no longer active.&#39;&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> LLMs learn patterns from text. Explicit instructions, format specifications (like JSON schema), and few-shot examples help the model identify the relevant patterns for extraction and structure the output accordingly.</li>

<h3>16. Generating Reasoning Steps/Answers (Complex Reasoning Tasks)</h3>
<p>This encompasses techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Self-Ask, which are designed to improve the AI&#39;s ability to handle complex problems and logic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To guide the AI through explicit reasoning steps to solve complex problems, improve accuracy, and make the process transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant Prompt Elements:</strong> Instructions, Input Data (the problem), Context, Output Indicator/Format (showing steps).</li>
<li><strong>Prompting Strategies:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT):</strong> Instruct the AI to generate intermediate reasoning steps before providing the final answer. Use phrases like &quot;<strong>think step by step</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>let&#39;s work through this</strong>&quot;. Break complex problems into smaller parts and ask for intermediate conclusions. CoT elicits reasoning by decomposing the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Few-Shot CoT:</strong> Provide examples of the problem-solving process, including the step-by-step reasoning leading to the correct answer.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-Shot CoT:</strong> Simply add &quot;Let&#39;s think step by step&quot; or a similar phrase to the prompt, relying on the model&#39;s inherent ability to generate reasoning steps.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Consistency:</strong> This is a decoding strategy that works <em>with</em> CoT. It involves generating multiple diverse reasoning paths for the same problem and selecting the most consistent answer (often via majority vote). To implement, you&#39;d typically use a CoT prompt and configure the model to sample multiple outputs. The prompt itself doesn&#39;t necessarily change, but the model configuration and subsequent processing of outputs do.</li>
<li><strong>Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT):</strong> For very complex problems, guide the AI to explore multiple different possibilities or &quot;thoughts&quot; at each step, evaluate their promise, and select the best path. This can involve prompting for thought generation (&quot;generate 3 distinct possible next steps&quot;) and state evaluation (&quot;Evaluate the following thought... Rate its potential...&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Self-Ask:</strong> Prompt the model to first rephrase and expand upon the question, then break it down into simpler, sequential sub-questions, answer them, and finally synthesize the overall answer. This helps clarify ambiguity and structure reasoning. An example structure is &quot;Question: [Your complex question] Are follow up questions needed here: Yes. Follow up: [Sub-question 1] Intermediate answer: [...] Follow up: [Sub-question 2] Intermediate answer: [...] So the final answer is: [...]&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt Framework (Zero-Shot CoT Example from sources and Self-Ask example from):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Zero-Shot CoT:</strong>
&quot;<strong>Question:</strong> Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends and then found 7 more. If she had 24 clips at first, how many did she have at the end?
<strong>Instruction:</strong> <strong>Let&#39;s think step by step</strong>.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Self-Ask:</strong>
&quot;<strong>Instruction:</strong> Answer the following question by first asking and answering necessary follow-up questions step-by-step.
<strong>Question:</strong> Who lived longer, Theodor Haecker or Harry Vaughan Watkins?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> These techniques guide the LLM&#39;s internal process, encouraging it to activate step-by-step reasoning and explore possibilities rather than just generating a direct, potentially incorrect, answer. CoT generates intermediate steps, decomposing the problem. Self-Consistency uses multiple reasoning paths for reliability. ToT explores and evaluates multiple potential thoughts. Self-Ask breaks down the query and answers sub-questions sequentially.</li>
</ul>
<p>This detailed approach, incorporating objectives, strategies, relevant prompt elements, and examples, should allow you to craft prompts with the depth and clarity needed to guide the AI effectively for each of these tasks, drawing directly from the insights provided in the sources. Remember that prompt engineering is an iterative process, and testing and refining your prompts based on the outputs is key to achieving optimal results.</p>
