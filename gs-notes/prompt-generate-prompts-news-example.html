            <p>The search results confirm and expand upon the provided news description. The key elements are indeed the Trump administration&#39;s plan to &quot;aggressively&quot; revoke visas for Chinese students, especially those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or studying in &quot;critical fields,&quot; and new export controls on semiconductor design software to China. This is framed as a recent development (news articles dated May 29, 2025, and the current date is May 30, 2025). The news link provided (Times of India) is one of the sources reporting this. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is a key figure mentioned in these plans.</p>
<p>The impact is significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widespread concern among students, universities (financial impact, talent pipeline), and tech companies.</li>
<li>Threatens to disrupt a fragile US-China trade truce.</li>
<li>Beijing has condemned the move.</li>
<li>Seen as part of a broader US strategy to counter alleged technology theft and national security risks.</li>
<li>The export controls on semiconductor software (Electronic Design Automation - EDA) are described as a &quot;choke point.&quot;</li>

<p><strong>Core News Information:</strong>
The Trump administration has announced a plan to &quot;aggressively&quot; revoke visas for Chinese students, particularly targeting those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or those studying in &quot;critical fields.&quot; This policy, voiced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is causing widespread concern. Simultaneously, new U.S. export controls have been placed on semiconductor design software (Electronic Design Automation - EDA tools) to China, further impacting U.S.-China relations. These actions are seen as a significant escalation, potentially disrupting the fragile trade truce between the two nations and are framed as measures to protect U.S. national security and technology. Universities and tech companies are concerned about the potential loss of talent and revenue, while China has condemned these moves.</p>
