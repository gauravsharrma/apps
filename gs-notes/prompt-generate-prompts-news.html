            <p>Okay, I understand. You want two distinct prompt structures based on the information in the sources:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>prompt1</code></strong>: This prompt will take a news description and a link as input and produce the text of <strong><code>prompt2</code></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><code>prompt2</code></strong>: This prompt, generated by <strong><code>prompt1</code></strong>, will contain instructions for a language model to generate multiple types of content (blog post, article, YouTube short, X tweet, YouTube video, Instagram post, and Facebook post) based on the news details provided within its context.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are the structures for <strong><code>prompt1</code></strong> and <strong><code>prompt2</code></strong> based on the sources:</p>
<p><strong><code>prompt1</code> Structure</strong></p>
<p>This is the prompt you would input into an AI model initially. Its purpose is to act as a <strong>prompt generator</strong>. It takes your raw news information and organises it into a structured prompt for the next step.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role:</strong> Define the AI&#39;s role for this specific task.<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> You are a prompt engineering assistant specializing in processing news information to create content generation prompts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Instruction/Directive:</strong> Clearly state what you want the AI to do.<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> Your task is to take the provided news description and link, extract the key information, and generate a subsequent prompt, named <code>prompt2</code>. This <code>prompt2</code> will contain instructions for a language model to create multiple content outputs (blog post, article, YouTube short, X tweet, YouTube video, Instagram post, Facebook post) based on the core information from the provided news.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Input Data:</strong> Provide the specific information the AI needs to process.<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em><ul>
<li>News Description: {The Trump administration&#39;s plan to revoke visas for Chinese students, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields, has sparked widespread concern. This move, coupled with new export controls on semiconductor software, threatens to disrupt the fragile trade truce between the US and China.}</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Output Indicator:</strong> Specify the desired format or structure of the AI&#39;s response.<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> Generate the full text of <code>prompt2</code> starting with &quot;[PROMPT2 START]&quot; and ending with &quot;[PROMPT2 END]&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Set limitations on the AI&#39;s output for this prompt.<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> <code>prompt1</code> should only produce the text of <code>prompt2</code>. Do not generate any of the content outputs for the platforms (blog, tweet, etc.) in this response. <code>prompt2</code> should contain all necessary instructions for the <em>next</em> step of content generation, including incorporating the news context derived from your input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example <code>prompt1</code> to use:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Role: You are a prompt engineering assistant specializing in processing news information to create content generation prompts.
Instruction: Your task is to take the provided news description and link, extract the key information, and generate a subsequent prompt, named `prompt2`. This `prompt2` will contain instructions for a language model to create multiple content outputs (blog post, article, YouTube short, X tweet, YouTube video, Instagram post, Facebook post) based on the core information from the provided news.
Input Data:
News Description: The Trump administration&#39;s plan to revoke visas for Chinese students, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields, has sparked widespread concern. This move, coupled with new export controls on semiconductor software, threatens to disrupt the fragile trade truce between the US and China.

Output Indicator: Generate the full text of `prompt2` starting with &quot;[PROMPT2 START]&quot; and ending with &quot;[PROMPT2 END]&quot;.
Constraint: `prompt1` should only produce the text of `prompt2`. Do not generate any of the content outputs for the platforms (blog, tweet, etc.) in this response. `prompt2` should contain all necessary instructions for the *next* step of content generation, including incorporating the news context derived from your input.
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>prompt2</code> Structure</strong></p>
<p>This is the prompt that <strong><code>prompt1</code></strong> will generate. You would then take the text produced by <strong><code>prompt1</code></strong> (everything between &quot;[PROMPT2 START]&quot; and &quot;[PROMPT2 END]&quot;) and use it as your input for the AI model to generate the actual content for each platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role:</strong> Define the AI&#39;s role for the content generation task.<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> You are a versatile content generation AI, capable of creating outputs tailored for different media platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Instruction/Directive:</strong> Clearly state the task for this prompt.<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> Generate content outputs based on the provided news summary and details, tailored for the specific platforms listed below. Create a separate output section for each requested platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> This section will contain the summary and key details about the news event, processed and inserted by <strong><code>prompt1</code></strong>. Providing this background helps the AI understand the nuances of the request.<ul>
<li><em>Example (Content inserted by prompt1):</em>
Here is a summary of the news event derived from the initial input: The Trump administration is planning to revoke visas for Chinese students, especially those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or critical study fields. This action, combined with new export controls on semiconductor software, is causing widespread concern and threatens the US-China trade truce.

<p>This system uses <strong>prompt chaining</strong> to first process the input into a structured format suitable for various content tasks, and then use that structured output as the input for the final content generation prompt. Remember that prompt engineering is an <strong>iterative process</strong>, and you may need to refine these prompt structures based on the AI&#39;s responses to achieve the desired results. Providing <strong>clear and specific instructions</strong> and defining <strong>constraints</strong> are crucial for both prompts.</p>
